## Using Git

* [Git Basics](basics.md)
* [Adding and Changing Stuff](addingandchanging.md)
* [Undoing Changes](undoing.md)
* [Branch and Merge](branchandmerge.md)


## Viewing Changes and Commits

* Command to show the history of a repository in the terminal (command) window.  This form shows one line per commit, with a graph, and all branches.
    ```
    git log --oneline --graph --all
    ```
    Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

* The GUI tool `gitk` or `gitk --all` displays even more info about the commit history.


* The output of `git diff` can be hard to read. To view differences more visually:

    1. View differences on Github.
    2. Meld or Diffuse to compare and merge files. `git difftool` lists more tools.
    3. `gitk` shows diffs between commits
    4. Eclipse EGit shows side-by-side diffs and can merge interactively
